## Submission

Model and interface for the 1-day [Payments, Fraud, and Transparency: hAIckathon](https://gdsc.community.dev/events/details/developer-student-clubs-eth-zurich-presents-payments-fraud-and-transparency-haickathon), hosted by Picnic and organized by the Google Developers Club at ETH Zurich.

### Code
Since we had a large dataset of labelled data available, we tried different supervised learning approaches. The final model uses sklearn's [RandomForestClassifier](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestClassifier.html). The performance was assessed using the F1-score.

### Data
Since the customer data used for training and testing of the model are not publically available, they are not included in this repo. (NDA)
